# Bot-Automation
A simple Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script to demonstrate how browser automation technology (in this case Selenium) can be used to automate bot interactions on social networking platforms -- while appearing to be originating from a legitimate user. LinkedIn was the social network used for this particular PoC, because it is the social network which is most useful for adversarial threat actors attempting to target business organizations and professionals. Only 3 functions are included in the PoC, to include logging in, sending a message, and reading a message. This code was provided to demonstrate how threat actors can use browser automation libraries (like Selenium) to easily automate browser interactions.

This code was deliberately restricted to just a small number of functions, to demonstrate how these capabilities are misused by adveraries, but to minimize the risk of misuse by script kiddies.

A more detailed walkthrough on how to use Selenium to automate browser interactions can be found on my blog -- [Sociosploit - Building Bots with Mechanize and Selenium](https://www.sociosploit.com/2019/10/building-bots-with-mechanize-and.html)
